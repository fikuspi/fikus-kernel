/**
 * DOC: station table - introduction
 *
 * The station table is a list of data structure that reprensent the stations.
 * In STA/P2P client mode, the driver will hold one station for the AP/ GO.
 * In GO/AP mode, the driver will have as many stations as associated clients.
 * All these stations are reflected in the fw's station table. The driver
 * keeps the fw's station table up to date with the ADD_STA command. Stations
 * can be removed by the REMOVE_STA command.
 *
 * All the data related to a station is held in the structure %iwl_mvm_sta
 * which is embed in the mac80211's %ieee80211_sta (in the drv_priv) area.
 * This data includes the index of the station in the fw, per tid information
 * (sequence numbers, Block-ack state machine, etc...). The stations are
 * created and deleted by the %sta_state callback from %ieee80211_ops.
 *
 * The driver holds a map: %fw_id_to_mac_id that allows to fetch a
 * %ieee80211_sta (and the %iwl_mvm_sta embedded into it) based on a fw
 * station index. That way, the driver is able to get the tid related data in
 * O(1) in time sensitive paths (Tx / Tx response / BA notification). These
 * paths are triggered by the fw, and the driver needs to get a pointer to the
 * %ieee80211 structure. This map helps to get that pointer quickly.
 */

/**
 * DOC: station table - locking
 *
 * As stated before, the station is created / deleted by mac80211's %sta_state
 * callback from %ieee80211_ops which can sleep. The next paragraph explains
 * the locking of a single stations, the next ones relates to the station
 * table.
 *
 * The station holds the sequence number per tid. So this data needs to be
 * accessed in the Tx path (which is softIRQ). It also holds the Block-Ack
 * information (the state machine / and the logic that checks if the queues
 * were drained), so it also needs to be accessible from the Tx response flow.
 * In short, the station needs to be access from sleepable context as well as
 * from tasklets, so the station itself needs a spinlock.
 *
 * The writers of %fw_id_to_mac_id map are serialized by the global mutex of
 * the mvm op_mode. This is possible since %sta_state can sleep.
 * The pointers in this map are RCU protected, hence we won't replace the
 * station while we have Tx / Tx response / BA notification running.
 *
 * If a station is deleted while it still has packets in its A-MPDU queues,
 * then the reclaim flow will notice that there is no station in the map for
 * sta_id and it will dump the responses.
 */

/**
 * DOC: station table - internal stations
 *
 * The FW needs a few internal stations that are not reflected in
 * mac80211, such as broadcast station in AP / GO mode, or AUX sta for
 * scanning and P2P device (during the GO negotiation).
 * For these kind of stations we have %iwl_mvm_int_sta struct which holds the
 * data relevant for them from both %iwl_mvm_sta and %ieee80211_sta.
 * Usually the data for these stations is static, so no locking is required,
 * and no TID data as this is also not needed.
 * One thing to note, is that these stations have an ID in the fw, but not
 * in mac80211. In order to "reserve" them a sta_id in %fw_id_to_mac_id
 * we fill ERR_PTR(EINVAL) in this mapping and all other dereferencing of
 * pointers from this mapping need to check that the value is not error
 * or NULL.
 *
 * Currently there is only one auxiliary station for scanning, initialized
 * on init.
 */

/**
 * DOC: station table - AP Station in STA mode
 *
 * %iwl_mvm_vif includes the index of the AP station in the fw's STA table:
 * %ap_sta_id. To get the point to the coresponsding %ieee80211_sta,
 * &fw_id_to_mac_id can be used. Due to the way the fw works, we must not remove
 * the AP station from the fw before setting the MAC context as unassociated.
 * Hence, %fw_id_to_mac_id[%ap_sta_id] will be NULLed when the AP station is
 * removed by mac80211, but the station won't be removed in the fw until the
 * VIF is set as unassociated. Then, %ap_sta_id will be invalidated.
 */

/**
 * DOC: station table - Drain vs. Flush
 *
 * Flush means that all the frames in the SCD queue are dumped regardless the
 * station to which they were sent. We do that when we disassociate and before
 * we remove the STA of the AP. The flush can be done synchronously against the
 * fw.
 * Drain means that the fw will drop all the frames sent to a specific station.
 * This is useful when a client (if we are IBSS / GO or AP) disassociates. In
 * that case, we need to drain all the frames for that client from the AC queues
 * that are shared with the other clients. Only then, we can remove the STA in
 * the fw. In order to do so, we track the non-AMPDU packets for each station.
 * If mac80211 removes a STA and if it still has non-AMPDU packets pending in
 * the queues, we mark this station as %EBUSY in %fw_id_to_mac_id, and drop all
 * the frames for this STA (%iwl_mvm_rm_sta). When the last frame is dropped
 * (we know about it with its Tx response), we remove the station in fw and set
 * it as %NULL in %fw_id_to_mac_id: this is the purpose of
 * %iwl_mvm_sta_drained_wk.
 */

/**
 * DOC: station table - fw restart
 *
 * When the fw asserts, or we have any other issue that requires to reset the
 * driver, we require mac80211 to reconfigure the driver. Since the private
 * data of the stations is embed in mac80211's %ieee80211_sta, that data will
 * not be zeroed and needs to be reinitialized manually.
 * %IWL_MVM_STATUS_IN_HW_RESTART is set during restart and that will hint us
 * that we must not allocate a new sta_id but reuse the previous one. This
 * means that the stations being re-added after the reset will have the same
 * place in the fw as before the reset. We do need to zero the %fw_id_to_mac_id
 * map, since the stations aren't in the fw any more. Internal stations that
 * are not added by mac80211 will be re-added in the init flow that is called
 * after the restart: mac80211 call's %iwl_mvm_mac_start which calls to
 * %iwl_mvm_up.
 */

/**
 * DOC: AP mode - PS
 *
 * When a station is asleep, the fw will set it as "asleep". All the
 * non-aggregation frames to that station will be dropped by the fw
 * (%TX_STATUS_FAIL_DEST_PS failure code).
 * AMPDUs are in a separate queue that is stopped by the fw. We just need to
 * let mac80211 know how many frames we have in these queues so that it can
 * properly handle trigger frames.
 * When the a trigger frame is received, mac80211 tells the driver to send
 * frames from the AMPDU queues or AC queue depending on which queue are
 * delivery-enabled and what TID has frames to transmit (Note that mac80211 has
 * all the knowledege since all the non-agg frames are buffered / filtered, and
 * the driver tells mac80211 about agg frames). The driver needs to tell the fw
 * to let frames out even if the station is asleep. This is done by
 * %iwl_mvm_sta_modify_sleep_tx_count.
 * When we receive a frame from that station with PM bit unset, the
 * driver needs to let the fw know that this station isn't alseep any more.
 * This is done by %iwl_mvm_sta_modify_ps_wake.
