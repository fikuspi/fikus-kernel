/**
 * struct regulatory_request - used to keep track of regulatory requests
 *
 * @rcu_head: RCU head struct used to free the request
 * @wiphy_idx: this is set if this request's initiator is
 * 	%REGDOM_SET_BY_COUNTRY_IE or %REGDOM_SET_BY_DRIVER. This
 * 	can be used by the wireless core to deal with conflicts
 * 	and potentially inform users of which devices specifically
 * 	cased the conflicts.
 * @initiator: indicates who sent this request, could be any of
 * 	of those set in nl80211_reg_initiator (%NL80211_REGDOM_SET_BY_*)
 * @alpha2: the ISO / IEC 3166 alpha2 country code of the requested
 * 	regulatory domain. We have a few special codes:
 * 	00 - World regulatory domain
 * 	99 - built by driver but a specific alpha2 cannot be determined
 * 	98 - result of an intersection between two regulatory domains
 *	97 - regulatory domain has not yet been configured
 * @dfs_region: If CRDA responded with a regulatory domain that requires
 *	DFS master operation on a known DFS region (NL80211_DFS_*),
 *	dfs_region represents that region. Drivers can use this and the
 *	@alpha2 to adjust their device's DFS parameters as required.
 * @user_reg_hint_type: if the @initiator was of type
 *	%NL80211_REGDOM_SET_BY_USER, this classifies the type
 *	of hint passed. This could be any of the %NL80211_USER_REG_HINT_*
 *	types.
 * @intersect: indicates whether the wireless core should intersect
 * 	the requested regulatory domain with the presently set regulatory
 * 	domain.
 * @processed: indicates whether or not this requests has already been
 *	processed. When the last request is processed it means that the
 *	currently regulatory domain set on cfg80211 is updated from
 *	CRDA and can be used by other regulatory requests. When a
 *	the last request is not yet processed we must yield until it
 *	is processed before processing any new requests.
 * @country_ie_checksum: checksum of the last processed and accepted
 * 	country IE
 * @country_ie_env: lets us know if the AP is telling us we are outdoor,
 * 	indoor, or if it doesn't matter
 * @list: used to insert into the reg_requests_list linked list
