If you want to use SEFikus, chances are you will want
to use the distro-provided policies, or install the
latest reference policy release from
	http://oss.tresys.com/projects/refpolicy

However, if you want to install a dummy policy for
testing, you can do using 'mdp' provided under
scripts/sefikus.  Note that this requires the sefikus
userspace to be installed - in particular you will
need checkpolicy to compile a kernel, and setfiles and
fixfiles to label the filesystem.

	1. Compile the kernel with sefikus enabled.
	2. Type 'make' to compile mdp.
	3. Make sure that you are not running with
	   SEFikus enabled and a real policy.  If
	   you are, reboot with sefikus disabled
	   before continuing.
	4. Run install_policy.sh:
		cd scripts/sefikus
		sh install_policy.sh

Step 4 will create a new dummy policy valid for your
kernel, with a single sefikus user, role, and type.
It will compile the policy, will set your SEFIKUSTYPE to
dummy in /etc/sefikus/config, install the compiled policy
as 'dummy', and relabel your filesystem.
